Digger is a light-weight web application to centralize and share the accumulated collective knowledge about all the relational databases of the organization.

:sectnums!:

== Introduction

After decades of software development, we realized that data is more valuable than software. An application is more likely to be rewritten in a modern technology and continue pointing to an existing database than an existing application be modified to access data from a different database. Of course both cases exist, but applications tend to become more chaotic than databases.

Even with a longer time span, databases are rarely documented. Often, developers have to read the code to understand the meaning of tables, views, columns, and how to use them. It is not rare to find columns and tables that are not referenced at all, but we never know whether they are still in use by an obscure trigger, stored procedure or third-part application. If at least they had a defragmented and up-to-date documentation they could rely on.

:sectnums:

== Installation

Digger is easy to install but it requires Java 8+ installed and configured in the system. The application comes with an embedded database for simple use cases, but it can also be configured to store data in a PostgreSQL database server, which also has to be installed and configured separately.

=== Installing the Released File

Download Digger from the https://github.com/htmfilho/digger/releases[release page] and save it where you want to install it. That is a `jar` file with the naming convention: `digger-<version>.jar`. For example: `digger-1.2.0.jar`.

==== Using the Embedded Storage

To run Digger with its default configuration, go to the terminal and execute:

    $ cd <path-to-digger-folder>
    $ java -jar digger-1.2.0.jar

A few moments later, open your browser and visit the address http://localhost:8080 to use Digger with its embedded database. The folder `data` is automatically created during the initialization and the sign up page below is presented by default.

==== Using PostgreSQL Storage

The embedded database is robust enough to support a reasonable volume of data, but it won't scale to support multiple concurrent users. For that, you can use PostgreSQL to handle a larger demand for information. To switch to PostgreSQL:

1. if the application is already running, stop it using `[Ctrl+C]` in the terminal

2. create a sub-directory named `config` in the same directory of the application

3. download the files https://raw.githubusercontent.com/htmfilho/digger/master/config/application.properties[`application.properties`] and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/htmfilho/digger/master/config/application-server.properties[`application-server.properties`] and save them in the `config` folder

4. open the file `application.properties` and change the following entry from `embedded` to `server`:

    spring.profiles.active=server

5. Then open the file `application-server.properties` and change the following connection parameters to your PostgreSQL server:

    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/digger
    spring.datasource.username=digger_usr
    spring.datasource.password=secret

6. Restart the application to take the new configuration into account:

    $ java -jar digger-1.2.0.jar

7. Finally, refresh the page http://localhost:8080

Make sure the database user has full rights over Digger's database, so it can generate the schema and perform all operations.

=== Installing From Source

A new version of Digger is released from time to time, but if you can't wait for a feature that was just finished, then you may need to build Digger from source. To do it, you need:

 - https://openjdk.java.net/[JDK], a Java Development Kit to compile and run the code,

 - https://maven.apache.org/[Maven], a traditional software life-cycle management tool for Java, and

 - https://git-scm.com/[Git], a distributed version control system. Please, visit their respective documentation and get them installed and configured in your system.

To start, fetch the code from GitHub:

    $ git clone https://github.com/htmfilho/digger.git

Then build the project:

    $ cd digger
    $ mvn package

All the artifacts you need are ready! The jar file is now available at `target/` and the configuration files at `config/`. You can run it using the java command:

    $ java -jar target/digger-1.2.0.jar

or Maven:

    $ mvn spring-boot:run

If you already have Digger installed, just put the generated jar file in the same folder of the existing installation and remove the old jar. Execute the new jar from that point on.

You can also get all subsequent changes whenever they are available by fetching updates:

    $ git pull origin master

Then you can package and run it:

    $ mvn clean package

=== Installing as a Local Service

Sometime, we spend so much time documenting database schemes that we want Digger to be constantly available. We also want it to start with the operating system in case the system needs to boot. Digger can be configured to start as a local service to address these cases.

=== A Linux Service

Create a new service file `digger.service` at `/etc/systemd/system` with the following content:

[source, toml]
----
[Unit]
Description = Digger - Database Schema Documentation Tool

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/digger
User=digger
Group=digger
StandardOutput=syslog+console
StandardError=syslog+console
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /opt/digger/digger-standalone.jar

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
----

Then execute the following commands:

    $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    $ sudo systemctl enable digger.service

=== A Windows Service

== Security

Digger ensures that only authorized people in the organization are allowed to document and to access the documentation of the schemes. Users are managed by the application and their passwords are strongly encrypted in the database, to the point they cannot be recovered, only reset.

=== Signing Up

When Digger starts for the first time, it forces the creation of the first user account by automatically redirecting the user to the Sign Up page. The role of administrator (ROLE_ADMIN) is automatically assigned to the first user, who is empowered to manage the application including other users.

.User Sign Up
image::images/signup.png[]

All people signing up after the first user are disabled and assigned to the role of Reader by default. That's why the user cannot login after the sign up. The administrator must enable the user and assign him or her to the appropriate role or leave the user as reader.

=== Login

The login tries to match the user's credentials. If the matching is successful, the user is allowed into the application to access confidential information, otherwise the user is informed that the matching was unsuccessful.

.User authentication
image::images/login.png[]

=== User Profile

Once the login is successful, users have access to their profile by clicking on the user's menu on the top right and selecting *Profile*. This is a section that give information and some control over the user experience.

.User Profile
image::images/profile.png[]

One of the capabilities available in the profile is the password change. Users are able to change their password whenever they feel it can improve their security. To change your password:

1. Click on the *Change Password* button available in the profile

2. fill in your current password to confirm your identity

3. fill in your new password in the *New Password* and *Confirm New Password* fields

4. Click on *Submit* to confirm the change or *Cancel* to return to the profile

.Changing Password

== Features

Digger gives you a good set of features to help you document the database schemes of your organization.

[#admin]
=== Administration

The administration is accessible via the top menu, in the "Admin" option. It allows the administrator to manage user accounts.

image::images/administration.png[]

NOTE:: This feature is limited to administrators. Other roles won't see this option in the menu.

[#admin-users]
==== Users

Administrators need to have control over the users to ensure the confidentiality of the information managed by Digger. They can find in this section the essential to manage the users.

image::images/users.png[]

===== Enabling and Disabling a User

After signing up, a user doesn't have instant access to Digger. All users are disabled by default and the administrator has to enable them. To enable a user:

1. click on the "Admin" option on the top menu and select "Users" in the list
2. check the users you want to enable and uncheck the ones you want to disable

===== User's Details

In the *User's Details* section, the administration can see all information related to the user and related options such as *Edit* and *Delete*.

.User's Details
image::images/user.png[]

===== Changing the Role of a User

Digger defines 3 levels of authority represented by roles. They are:

- *Administrator*: has access to all functionalities of the system.

- *Editor*: has rights limited to document and visualize the documentation of the schemas.

- *Reader*: has rights limited to visualizing the documentation of the schema.

The first user of Digger is assigned to the role of Administrator and all subsequent users are assigned to the role of Reader. Only the administrator has the right to change the role of a user. To do this:

1. Click on the "Admin" option on the top menu and select "Users" in the list
2. click on the user you want to change
3. click on the button "Options" and select "Edit" in the list
4. select the role you want for that user and save

[#datasources]
=== Datasources

Datasource is a reference to an existing database that we intend to document. A datasource has enough information to connect to the database and extract metadata from it.

image::images/datasources.png[]

[#datasource-form]
==== Creating and Editing a Datasource

To create a new datasource, click on the *New* button on the top right of the list of datasources. It opens the datasource form, where you can give it a *Name*, give more details about it in the *Description*, and inform the connection attributes. The *Driver Class* drop-down field offers a list of the currently supported database engines. Each driver requires a different URL format, so when a driver is selected, its corresponding URL template appears below the *URL* field for reference. Finally, inform a valid *Username* and *Password* with at least _Read_ privileges to the database. Click on *Save* to register the information or *Cancel* to go back to the datasource list.

image::images/datasource-form.png[]

To edit a datasource, click on it in the list. In the datasource page, click on the button *Options* on the top right, then select the option *Edit*. The same form appears, but this time completely filled. Make the intended changes and *Save*.

[#datasource]
==== The Datasource

The datasource page shows all information related to the datasource, as well as all possible operations such as *Edit*, *Remove*, *Add Table*, *Ignore Tables*, etc.

image::images/datasource.png[]

[#tables]
=== Tables

A datasource's Table is a tabular structure used to store, organize and retrieve data. It can be a database table, a temporary table, a view, and other vendor specific alternatives. They are listed in the datasource page, from where they can be reached and documented.

image::images/tables.png[]

[#new_table]
==== Documenting a Table

To document a table, go to the datadource that the table belongs to, then to the "Tables" section, and click on the *New* button on the right. Filling the form by selecting the physical name of the table in the dropdown, confirming the type that is automatically detected, a friendly name that is more readable than the physical mame, and write down everything you know about that table.

Click on the *Save* button to complete or *Cancel* to go back to the datasource page.

image::images/table-form.png[]

The *Documentation* field uses https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[Asciidoc] as markup language. It has a human friendly syntax to allow anybody write rich content without touching any HTML or CSS code.

Visit the Appendix A to learn everything you need to know to properly format your documentation.

[#table]
==== A Table

The table's page shows all information related to the table, including its columns. To edit a table, click on the *Options* button on the top right then select the option *Edit*. The form appears filled with the table's attributes and documentation. Make the intended changes and save, or cancel to return to the table's page.

== Contributing to the Project

Follow these instructions if you want to contribute to Digger.

=== Assumptions

We assume your development environment is configured with:

 - **Java 8+**: you can perform the commands `java` and `javac` in your terminal
 - **Maven 3**: you can perform the command `mvn` in your terminal
 - **Git**: you can perform the command `git` in your terminal

=== Local Environment Setup

We favour the use of the command line to set up the local environment, so we do not depend on any other tool for this basic step. Open the Windows/Linux terminal and start by cloning the repository in your local machine:

    $ cd [your-java-projects-folder]
    $ git clone https://github.com/htmfilho/digger.git

It creates the folder `digger` that contains the entire source code of the application. Execute the following Maven command to build, test, and run the application:

    $ cd digger
    $ mvn spring-boot:run

Visit the local address http://localhost:8080/ to use the application. To stop it, type `Ctrl+C` on the terminal.

=== Data Model

The data managed by Digger is persisted in a relational database. If you launched Digger as is, without changing the configuration, you are using the embedded database https://www.h2database.com[H2]. If you are using the server configuration then you are using https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL]. The data is organized according to the following diagram.

.Digger's Entity Relational Model
image::images/entity-relationship-diagram.png[]

=== Test Automation

To execute the test suite, run:

    $ mvn test

Only submit your pull request if these tests pass. To see the test coverage report, open the page generated at `target/site/jacoco`.

=== Technologies in Use

 - https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html[Spring MVC]
 - https://spring.io/projects/spring-security[Spring Security]
 - http://www.thymeleaf.org[Thymeleaf]
 - https://www.h2database.com[H2]
 - https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL]

=== Using Git

==== Changing The Author To The One Recognizable by GitHub

In case your default Git author is not the same as GitHub, configure the author of the repository:

    $ git config user.name "John Doe"
    $ git config user.email "john@doe.org"

It can also be done to a specific commit:

    $ git commit --author="John Doe <john@doe.org>"

==== Changing Several Commits in Bulk

If commits were done with a wrong author, use Git Rebase to fix the authors of the commits:

    $ git rebase -i -p <commit-id>
    $ git commit --amend --author="John Doe <john@doe.org>"
    $ git rebase --continue
    $ git push -f origin master

==== Adding a File to the Most Recent Commit

    $ git add missed-file.txt
    $ git commit --amend
