Digger is designed to document existing databases. It is specially useful to document legacy databases, where the documentation is diffuse and outdated.

This documentation targets application users. If you are a developer and wants to contribute to this project, you may find the https://www.hildeberto.com/digger/documentation[technical documentation] useful.
